# User Guide

## Prerequisites

You need a Web3 wallet (such as MetaMask) connected to the correct network with enough ETH to cover gas fees. The application runs on a local test network during development.

## Connect Wallet

Click "Connect Wallet" on the frontend. Your wallet will prompt you to authorize the connection and confirm the network.

## Mint NFTs

The contract owner mints NFTs to user addresses. Each NFT has a rarity tier (Common, Rare, Epic, or Legendary) and two game stats: power and agility. Once minted, the NFT appears in your wallet and its attributes are permanent.

## View Inventory

The inventory section displays all NFTs you currently own, including their token ID, rarity, and stats. Staked NFTs will not appear here — they are held by the staking contract until you unstake them.

## Stake NFTs

Before staking, you must approve the staking contract to transfer your NFTs. Select one or more NFTs and confirm the stake transaction — your NFTs will be transferred into the contract and begin earning GGOLD rewards based on their rarity.

## Unstake NFTs

Select any of your staked NFTs and confirm the unstake transaction. The NFTs are returned to your wallet and reward accrual for those items stops immediately. Any unclaimed rewards remain available to claim.

## Claim Rewards

Click "Claim" to receive all accumulated GGOLD tokens to your wallet. Rewards accrue every second while your NFTs are staked, with higher-rarity items earning proportionally more. Your GGOLD balance updates after the transaction confirms.
